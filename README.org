Inspired by bandwidthd, by David Hinkle.  Special thanks to the bandwidthd 
team of developers. Thanks also to DerbyTech, now DerbyNet of Illinois, who
funded the original bandwidthd.

** LICENSE 
Normally, everything I write I release under the ZLib license. However, in
keeping with and gratitude for the original bandwidthd, this project is
licensed under the GPL 2.0.

** WHAT IT IS
Bandwidthd-ng is a UNIX daemon for logging or graphing IPv4/IPv6 traffic  
generated by each machine on several configurable subnets. It can log
to cdf files, or psql or sqlite databases, as well as generate graphs itself.

In live graphing mode, each IP which has transferred more than a small amount
of data (configurable, 1mb default) is graphed, as is each monitored subnet
as a whole. The graph format is mostly the same, down to the same colors, as
the original, but the format is svg instead of png. This lets even a modest
machine genrate graphs very quickly.

** PORTABILITY
Bandwidthd-ng will compile and run on any platform with libpcap, and a recent
version of clang and libcxx. This sounds like a bigger restriction than it is,
as Gentoo provides libcxx for most platforms. A fully static build is about
1.7MB, upx gets it down to about 500kb. If you can use the target system's libc,
you can cut that about in half. It's also possible to swap the stl containers
for embedded stl implementations.

At runtime, it takes about 8mb of RAM on 64 bit platforms, and about half that
on 32bit platforms. Again, swapping to an embedded stl, disabling exceptions,
and disabling features at compile time can cut that about in half.

** CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS

The primary build target of bandwidthd-ng is the /classic/ target, which aims to
support the same feature set and config compatibility with the original
bandwidthd, all in one executable. There are some differnces, largely because I
can't run the original bandwidthd to verify its behavior. I also never used it
to generate graphs. So I only have the old C source code and the docs to
recreate it. Its psql backend entirely works as a drop-in replacemnt.

The original relied on php to genrate graphs from the database, which resulted
in db-driven graphs looking different to the live graphs. bandwidthd-ng provides
a graphing program that uses the same module to create the graphs. For fully
dynamic graphs, this library is exposed through the Python wrapper, so you can
query the db via python's db2 api, and pass the data to the traffic grapher to
generate the svgs.

** GRAPHING INTERVAL
bandwidthd-ng graphs all active IPs in targeted subnets, every 200 seconds.
You can still use the skip interval to reduce that frequency. If you want
more fine grained control, use a database.  The end application code is also
very simple, so you can easily make new frontends with different behavior. If
you write one that works exactly as you wish, send it to me and I can include
it.

** CDF LOGGING
bandwidthd-ng's cdf logging is off by default. It uses the same cdf format as
before. Currently, it can't recover cdfs on startup, though that should be easy
to add. It also doesn't do its own log rotating anymore. On modern Linux
systems, you /usually/ want to put log rotation under the control of your
service manager. It doesn't keep the log file open between writes, so simply
moving the file out from under it is sufficient to rotate the log.

** GRAPHING
Summary webpages are not generated. I may write a simple frontend using the
python extension, but that is fairly low priority.

** SPECIFYING THE LIBPCAP FILTER

You can set the libpcap filter on the light utilities via the ~--filter~
parameter. In the classic program, you can set it via the

filter "args"

format in the config file. The default is "ip or ipv6", which usually works
well.


** DATABASE SUPPORT

Like with the original bandwidthd, bandwidthd-ng supports sending data to an
external database. It also supports reading data back from postgres for graphs.
It can send data /to/ sqlite3, but you'll need the python plugin to graph from
that. Also keep in mind sqlite3 doesn't like multiple concurrent access, so take
a copy or otherwise prevent your reader from colliding with bandwidthd-ng's
writes.  For psql, you can have multiple sensors running, sharing a database.
The sensor id is included in the database records.

Using bandwidthd-ng with a database, especially if using the db-only sensor,
reduces the resource demands considerably. An embedded-stl/noexcept build of
the psql-sensor needs under 1mb of ram, for reasonable subnet sizes.

*** DATABASE INSTRUCTIONS

You must have a postgresql server running somewhere accessible to the user
account running bandwidthd-ng or psql-sensor. 

Setup:
1. Create a database for bandwidthd.

2. For the classic program, ensure your bandwidthd.conf has the following set

#+begin_src bash

graph false
recover_cdf false
output_cdf false

# fqdns work well, in reverse order for sorting, but any ascii string under 255
# characters works well.
sensor_id "com.example.sensorN"
   
# same as php and classic uses. I think libpqxx will read environment variables
# for this, but this string must be non-empty to enable graphing.
pgsql_connect_string "user = un dbname = db host = example.com"
#+end_src

3. Start bandwidthd-ng. If you pass ~-D~ it won't fork, which will make error
   identification easier. Wait 200 seconds, then check psql, you should see
   entries.

*** psql purging
The original bandwidthd shipped with a script to compact old psql data, by
virtually increasing the sample duration on data older than some threshold. It
is worth grabbing that script and running it nightly if you are using this in a
large scale environment. Since the database is the same format, the old script
should work. If I get around to writing the web frontend, I'll probably
integrate the functionality into that.
